## Data Carpentry Reimbursement Policy

**Approved 2017-06-12**

 *Designed to be consistent with NumFOCUS reimbursement policies in independent contractor contracts.*

### I. Policy Statement

Business expenses may be reimbursed if an individual paid the expense from personal funds.

This policy establishes the three components required for reimbursement of allowable non-compensation business expenses:
- An allowable business expense
- Substantiation of the expense with receipts and expense report
- Approval of the expense

### II. Who is Affected by this Policy

This policy affects all employees, volunteers, independent contractors, and guests seeking reimbursement or payment for necessary and reasonable non-compensation business expenses.

### III. Definitions

#### Necessary
Minimum purchase or service required to achieve a particular objective.

#### Reasonable
An expense that is ordinary and reflects a prudent decision to incur the expense on behalf of Data Carpentry business. Not extreme or excessive.

#### Appropriate expense
An expense that is suitable or fitting for a particular valid Data Carpentry business purpose or activity.

#### Allowable expense
A necessary, reasonable, and appropriate expense incurred for the primary benefit of Data Carpentry activities and therefore permitted to be reimbursed or directly charged based on the permission of Data Carpentry. Allowable expenses must meet [501(c)3 expense policies](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p535.pdf).

#### Original Receipt
The original merchant receipt or invoice issued by the supplier or service provider to document and substantiate the business transaction. A digital image of the original receipt is allowable provided that it is legible. Electronic receipts are allowable.

#### Substantiation
Documentation to support an incurred business expense that includes the original receipt, documentation of business purpose, names of persons in attendance, and an appropriate expense report for the incurred cost.

### IV. Policy

Data Carpentry provides reimbursement for appropriate and allowable expenses. These are business and travel related expenses, including transportation, hotels, and food. These expenses must be reasonable and necessary, as well as job-related.

#### SUBSTANTIATION AND ORIGINAL RECEIPTS
In order for a business expense to be approved and reimbursed, it must be properly substantiated. Original receipts (see above definition) for all expenditures are required. If sponsored by a particular agency or organization and requirements are more restrictive, the more restrictive receipt requirement will take precedence. If a required receipt has been lost, that information must be included when the reimbursement request is made.

#### EXPENSE REPORT
Reimbursement as a nontaxable payment can be made as long as:
- the expense qualifies as an allowable business expense and
- all substantiation and receipt requirements are met.  

The sections below establish Data Carpentry policy for reimbursement based on proper substantiation of the business expense, timely request for reimbursement, and payment approval.

#### APPROVAL AND REIMBURSEMENT
For each business expense reimbursement being requested, the request must include
- the valid business purpose of the expense and
- if travel related, the location and dates of the event.

#### DEADLINE TO SUBMIT EXPENSE REPORTS AND DOCUMENTATION
#### Expense Reimbursement Deadlines
To be reimbursable, business expenses must be properly substantiated and submitted within certain time limitations.
- Substantiation for the reimbursement should be submitted within 60 calendar days of when the expenses were incurred. For expenses incurred while traveling, the traveler will have 60 calendar days upon returning from travel to substantiate and submit the expenses.
- If substantiation occurs more than 60 calendar days after the expenses were incurred, the expense reimbursement request must include an explanation for the delay. Data Carpentry may deny reimbursement requests submitted or substantiated after the 60-day limit.

#### Advance Payments

 Funds can be reimbursed before travel is completed, with receipts for the travel expenditure.

#### Return of Excess Amounts
Return of excess amounts must be done within 120 days after expenses are paid or incurred.

If individual is staff, unsubstantiated advances, i.e., “excess amounts,” not returned to Data Carpentry within 120 calendar days of when paid will be deducted from the individual’s pay. Notification will be sent to the employee at least two weeks in advance of the deduction.

If individuals are volunteers, they will continue to be expected to repay “excess amounts” and it may affect their volunteer status with the organization.

### V. Procedures

#### REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST

Those expecting reimbursement are responsible for discerning appropriate and allowable expenses.Requests must include
- Person requesting
- Vendor (for business expenses)
