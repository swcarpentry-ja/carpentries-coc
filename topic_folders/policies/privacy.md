Yes. All communication with us is opt-in, except for participants receiving information about their program and for instructors, information required to maintain instructor status. You may occasionally be sent emails asking if you would like to opt-in to communication channels that we feel may be of interest to you (for example, a mailing list dedicated to your geographical area). In the absence of specific action from you, we will assume you choose not to join these channels.

#### Removing personal information
Participants may choose to disallow us from retaining their personal information at any time by notifying [admin@carpentries.org](mailto:admin@carpentries.org). If you choose to exclude your information, we will delete your personal information from our databases. This may interfere with our ability to give you credit for training events you have completed or to contact you about upcoming events in your area.
