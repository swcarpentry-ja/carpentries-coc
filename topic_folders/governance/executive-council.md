## The Carpentries Executive Council

### About the Executive Council

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries. It is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the Council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organization’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms.

The governance of The Carpentries by the Executive Council is outlined in the [Bylaws](bylaws.md).

In addition to [publicly posting meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes), the Executive Council reports on its activities periodically in [Carpentry Clippings](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/) (the organizational newsletter) as well as [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-governance).
The council also prepares [Yearly Summaries](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/year-in-review) of its activities.


### Contacting the Executive Council
If you have a question or concern for the Executive Council,
there are three ways for communicating with Executive Council Members:

1. **File an [issue](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/issues) in this repository.** This is appropriate if you would like to solicit additional community feedback on a topic of general interest to the community.
2. **Send us an [email](mailto:carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org).** This is appropriate for communicating directly with the Executive Council but not the rest of our community.
3. **Submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdo7AlYfeQN-z5dnO-p8KVI8t17kQUc1VH-Cvrlga5txIwCA/viewform?usp=sf_link).** This is preferable if you would like confidential communication with the Executive Council, or if you would like to remain anonymous.

### The Carpentries Executive Council Documentation

The information below describes all procedures, routines and resources
relevant for the Executive Council.
This information is added here as onboarding information
for new Executive Council members,
as well as to provide transparency for the community.

NOTE that a number of links lead to pages for which access is
restricted to Executive Council members.
We wish to be as transparent as we can,
but sometimes we need to choose to withhold information from others.

#### Responsibilities of all Executive Council Members

The [Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council)
describe the formal responsibilities of the Executive Council from an
organisational level. This text describes the current implementation of the tasks described in the bylaws and represents
flexible guidelines that may be adapted as the Executive Council deems necessary. In addition to documenting Executive Council standard operating
procedures, it is also intended to clarify Executive Council function for the broader community and help potential members understand the
commitment to serve on the Executive Council.

In practice, each Executive Council member is responsible for the following general tasks:

* Supporting the Mission and Vision of The Carpentries
* Exemplifying the Code of Conduct
* Ensuring The Carpentries’ adherence to legal agreements and standards
* Offering their expertise to help ensure the health and success of the organization
* Actively participating in discussions about strategic and financial decisions
* Providing feedback and voting on formal motions within one week of their posting
* Attending (in person or by phone/web-based) at least 75% of the meetings held each year
* Dedicating at least three volunteer hours per week toward Carpentries activities (including meeting attendance)

The specific commitments expected of Executive Council members include monthly meetings (1-1.5 hours, online) and a once-yearly
face-to-face meeting (expenses covered by The Carpentries). Minutes for these meetings are published to [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes) after
approval by Executive Council members. We may periodically schedule additional virtual meetings to address particular topics. Officers and Executive Council
liaisons to Committees or Task Forces may have additional commitments for meetings. Asynchronous commitments involve suggesting
agenda items for meetings, responding to email requests for opinions, and formal voting on resolutions (as issues in this
repository), and work resulting from being on a task force or committee representing the Executive Council.

### Officers

Executive Council officers are selected at the first regular meeting following election and appointment of new members and serve one year
terms. Officer positions include:

* Chair
* Vice Chair
* Secretary
* Treasurer

General tasks for each officer position are described in
[the bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council).
More detailed descriptions can be found on the page describing the [Executive Council officers responsibilities](executive-council-officers.html).

### Communication

We use two mailing lists:

* executive-council@carpentries.org: this is an internal list, and includes Executive Council and Executive Director; this list can only receive messages from list members
* carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org: recipients are Executive Council Chair and Vice Chair; anyone can send to this, allowing the community to communicate directly with the Executive Council (but not the rest of our community)

### Meetings

The Executive Council generally meets once monthly (we are required to hold at least 10 meetings a year, either in person or online). Smaller groups of Executive Council members may hold additional meetings when needed.

- [Publicly available meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes)

#### Onboarding new Executive Council members

New (incoming) members (both Community-elected and Council-elected) are announced in late December/early January. The official term of office for incoming Executive Council members is February 1. We ask that incoming members attend the final regularly scheduled meeting of the current Executive Council in January,
prior to taking office, to learn how meetings operate, and to prepare for formal transfer of responsibility.

The outgoing Chair and/or Vice Chair should meet with the incoming Executive Council members and Executive Director in January to discuss the following key points:

* The general workflow of the Executive Council
  * monthly meetings
  * as-needed special meetings and yearly in-person meeting
  * asynchronous communications
* Where different types of information are stored
* Responsibilities and expectations for all Executive Council members

#### Access to resources

Executive Council members have access to the following resources:

* Google Drive folder <u>Carpentries_Executive_Council</u>
* GitHub organisations, teams, and repositories
  * Organisation: carpentries
    * Team: carpentries/executive-council

    * Team: carpentries-ec/ec
    * Repo: Executive Council + Executive Director
    * Repo: Executive Council only
* Mailing list (listserv)
  - executive-council@carpentries.org
* Executive Council Google Calendar

Incoming Executive Council members should be granted access to these resources in January. Outgoing members' access to these resources should be removed in February.

Additionally, The Carpentries' website that includes the [Executive Council Members/Officers](http://static.carpentries.org/governance/) should be updated.

The following Executive Council roles should be assigned at the February meeting (these require formal voting by Executive Council members):

  * Vice Chair
  * Secretary
  * Treasurer
* Committee representatives (these may continue from previous terms as applicable):
