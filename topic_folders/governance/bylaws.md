# The Carpentries Bylaws

[The Executive Council welcomes community feedback on these bylaws. See [our contact information](https://carpentries.org/governance/#contacting-the-executive-council).]

## 1. Purpose

**Vision**: The Carpentries vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills.

**Mission**: The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and supporting research.

## 2. Lesson Programs

### Overview
Lesson Programs are collections of lessons which comprise one or more Carpentries workshops and the leadership guiding their development and implementation. The following requirements outline the general expectations associated with Lesson Programs; additional detail can be found in the [Lesson Program Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/lesson-program-policy.html).

### Eligibility for Lesson Program Acceptance
The Executive Council is responsible for assessing a prospective Lesson Program for acceptance into The Carpentries, which requires a majority vote. The Executive Director in coordination with relevant core team and Executive Council members will be responsible for:  developing and implementing policies related to Lesson Program incubation and assessing the ability of the Core Team and community to meet obligations associated with new Lesson Programs.

### Roles and Responsibilities of Lesson Programs
A Lesson Program within The Carpentries should possess the following characteristics:
- Intention and purpose for lessons that align with The Carpentries mission and vision
- Goals and objectives for lessons and/or workshops that are distinct from other Lesson Programs
- Service to a particular audience of learners and instructors
- Evidence of community member commitment to Lesson Program governance (see below), lesson maintenance, and curriculum development

### Governance of Lesson Programs
Each Lesson Program will have a Curriculum Advisory Committee to serve as community governance organisation and act as a point of contact with The Carpentries Executive Council and Core Team. The Curriculum Advisory Committee will provide the Executive Council with an annual report of Lesson Program operations.

### Resignation and Termination of Lesson Programs
In the event that either the Lesson Program or The Carpentries is not fulfilling its obligations under the Lesson Program Policy, or the mission and vision of The Carpentries and the Lesson Program no longer align, the relationship between the Lesson Program and The Carpentries can be terminated. The Executive Council may decide to retire the Lesson Program through a majority vote, or the Curriculum Advisory Committee can choose to discontinue the Lesson Program's association with The Carpentries. In either case, notice must be given to the other organisation to arrange for separation of responsibilities and resources.  

## 3. Organisational Membership

Member Organisations have committed to supporting the maintenance and growth of The Carpentries community according to the specific details outlined in each institution's Membership Agreement. In general, Member Organisations financially support The Carpentries in exchange for priority access to instructor training and guidance in building training capacity at their organisation.

## 4. Individual Voting Membership

The Carpentries community includes many opportunities for involvement representing variable levels of commitment. All individuals participating in community activities are required to conform to the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html). Individuals may choose to commit to serving in one or more formal roles in the community, such as Instructor, Trainer, or Maintainer, as defined by [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/index.html).

### Eligibility, Rights, and Termination for Voting Members
In a yearly timeframe associated with the dates of the election, starting December 1st, individuals who satisfy at least one of the following conditions are eligible for Voting Membership:

The Executive Director is not eligible for Voting Membership.

All individuals who satisfy conditions 1-3 above are automatically tracked and will receive Voting Membership. Contributing community members who satisfy condition 4 are indicated by having a badge in AMY, The Carpentries’ internal database. Community members that do not have a badge in AMY, but feel they have contributed sufficiently, can contact The Carpentries Core Team (team@carpentries.org) within a reasonable timeframe prior to release of ballots, as dictated by the Election Policy, to request their voting privileges updated.
Community members can log in to [AMY](https://amy.carpentries.org/account/login/)
to check their records and voting-eligible status. For more help with accessing and updating your AMY profile, please see [Accessing and Updating Your Instructor Profile](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/for_instructors/current_instructors.html#accessing-and-updating-your-instructor-profile).

Any individual who no longer wishes to be affiliated with The Carpentries or included as a Voting Member must inform The Carpentries Core Team for removal from membership lists. Voting Membership may be terminated by a majority vote of the Executive Council for individuals who are recommended for termination by the Code of Conduct Committee or Executive Director for non-compliance with The Carpentries policies or violation of the core values of The Carpentries.

- write, maintain and update the bylaws
- selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance
- strategic and organisational planning
- ensuring strong fiduciary oversight and financial management
- identifying revenue streams and resource development
- approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services

### Number, Tenure, Requirements, and Qualifications
The Executive Council will be composed of nine Members, each serving a two-year term. Member terms will begin on February 1st following the election, except when filling between-election vacancies (see below). Five Members of the Executive Council will be elected by the Executive Council (hereafter referred to as "Council-elected Members"). The other four Members will be elected by the Membership of the organisation ("Community-elected Members").
Executive Council members will not serve for more than three consecutive 2 year terms, followed by at least a one year hiatus before serving any new term(s).
No employer may have more than two elected or appointed representatives on the Executive Council, and Carpentries Core Team are not eligible to serve as Executive Council Members. The Executive Council has the final say in determining whether people are working for the same employer. If more than two people who are working for the same employer are elected, they must step down one by one to be replaced by other nominees in order of the number of votes received.

### Regular Meetings and Quorum
The Executive Council must meet at least ten times per year, either in person or online. Quorum for meetings of the Executive Council is five Members, including at least one Council-elected and one Community-elected Member. The Executive Council may use an asynchronous public online voting mechanism for motions to be approved inbetween regular meetings.

### Compensation
Members of the Executive Council shall not receive compensation from the Organisation for their service, with the exception of administrative support, travel, and accommodation costs related to their duties on the Executive Council.

### Confidentiality
Members of the Executive Council will sometimes discuss or be made aware of information or activities that may be sensitive to share publicly (e.g. salary information). Executive Council Members are expected to treat such information confidentially and to disclose such information to those outside the Executive Council only when the Executive Council has agreed that such dissemination is appropriate.

### Removal
If a Member of the Executive Council consistently fails to meet the obligations outlined above, they may be removed by a vote of three-quarters of the other Members of the Executive Council. A vote to remove a Member must be announced in writing (in the meeting agenda) to the entire Executive Council at least ten days in advance to vote on the removal. A vacated Executive Council seat will be filled following the Between-election vacancies procedure outlined in the Nominations and Elections section.

## 6. Nominations and Elections

### Overview
Four to five of the nine Members of the Executive Council will be elected each year, either by the community (Community-elected) or by the Executive Council (Council-elected). A general timeline for elections will occur annually as follows:

- Mid August: The Executive Council identifies an Executive Council member as point of contact for the election. The person should not be an Executive Council member who is standing for re-election
- Early September: Executive Council announces election, soliciting self-nominations for Community-elected Members and recommendations for Council-elected Members, and identifying areas of expertise desired by the Council
- Late October: Self-nominations and recommendations close and the Executive Council hosts Community Calls to discuss the election and introduce candidates for Community-elected Members
- Early November: Voting Members vote for Community-elected Members
- Mid-November: Executive Council elects Council-elected Members and announces the Executive Council Members for the following year
- February 1: Responsibility for governance is transferred to the new Executive Council

### Community-elected Members
Two Community-elected Members will be elected each year by the Voting Members of The Carpentries. Any Voting Member of The Carpentries may stand for election by announcing their candidacy as dictated by the Election Policy; Carpentries Core Team may not stand for election. If there are fewer than two candidates for the election, the current Community-elected Members whose seats are up for election will decide amongst them who will remain in office.

Elections will take place once every calendar year and no later than 30 days before the new Executive Council becomes active (February 1). Each Voting Member may vote for as many candidates as there are Community-elected Member seats to be filled. The candidates who receive the highest number of votes will be elected into the Executive Council.

### Council-elected Members
Two or three of the Council-elected Members will be elected each year. The Executive Council must consider at least one more candidate than the number of Council-elected Member seats to be filled. Anyone may recommend candidates for Council-elected positions.

Executive Council selects, by anonymous vote, the Council-elected Members from among the recommended candidates. Appointed Members will abstain from voting when they themselves are recommended for reappointment. Each Executive Council Member may vote for as many individuals as there are Council-elected Member seats to be filled. The individuals with the highest number of votes will be appointed. This vote will not take place until after the voting results for Community-elected Members are known and no later than December 15th.

### Between-election Vacancies
If an Executive Council seat of a Community-elected Member becomes vacant after the beginning of the year but before the first of October, the Executive Council will strive to fill the seat with one of the non-elected nominees from the previous year’s election, in the order of the number of votes they received. If this effort fails, the Executive Council may appoint a Voting Member to fill the seat.

If an Executive Council seat of a Council-elected Member becomes vacant after the beginning of the year but before the first of October, the Executive Council will strive to fill the seat with another eligible Voting Member.

In both of these cases, the vacancy will be filled by the new Executive Council Member for the remainder of the original term only.
