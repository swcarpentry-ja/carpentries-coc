TEACHING AND HOSTING
=======================

Opportunities for certified instructors to teach Carpentries workshops are listed `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=0>`_.  Join the `instructors mailing list <http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors>`_ to be notified when new opportunities are posted.

Certified instructors are also encouraged to run workshops themselves. When organising a workshop, you 
have two options: a centrally-organised or self-organised workshop. 

One way to understand the distinction between centrally-organised and self-organised workshops is who 
is responsible for certain key workshop components: 

**Centrally Organized Workshop**


* registration managed by The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team
* instructor recruitment managed by The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team

**Self-Organized Workshop**

* registration managed by local organizer
* instructor recruitment managed by local organizer

In both cases, the host site is expected to pay for instructor travel (if needed) and
cover local costs.  For a centrally organised workshop, there is a fee if the organiser
is not already a Carpentries member.

Note that you are free to charge what you choose for a workshop;
this is a perennial topic of discussion among the Carpentries community and there's
a good summary of points here: `Carpentries Blog on Charging for Workshops <https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/06/carpentries-workshops-fees/>`_.

In both cases (self- or centrally-organised), you can start the workshop
process by completing the `Carpentries workshop request form <https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/>`_ and 
then proceeding through the relevant checklists and list of tips below. 

For centrally organised workshops, the Regional Coordinator will guide the host and instructor(s) on following 
through on all these steps. A global team of Regional Coordinators support workshop activity and community building in regions around the world. `Read more <https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/>`_ about who they are and what they do.

For self organised workshops, the host and instructor are directly responsible for ensuring all the steps below are followed without support from the Regional Coordinator. If you are planning to self-organize a workshop, check out these `Tips for Organising Your First Carpentries Workshop <https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/10/organising-workshops/>`.
