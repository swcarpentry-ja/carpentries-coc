### Handling Emergencies

We know that unexpected things can happen, even with the best laid plans. Below are some tips to help deal with unexpected situations.  

**Situation: Co-instructor can't come due to illness, flight delay, etc.** 
* Contact team@carpentries.org.  Depending on how much notice we get, we may be able to help find another Instructor.
* Contact your helpers and host to see if any of them can provide extra support, and even teach a portion of the lessons
* If your co-Instructor is delayed (rather than having to cancel entirely), adjust the schedule of your event so that person's lesson come later in the event.

**Situation: Group can't get on wi-fi**
* If you anticipate this in advance, come with a handful of thumb drives to install software and data files
* If only some learners can get on wifi, consider pairing them up so they can follow on the connected person's machine

**Situation: Building or classroom is locked**
* Ensure that you have emergency contact information for hosts(s) before the workshop and any other people involved in logistics.
* Contact all participants if possible, and put signs on doors letting them know the workshop is postponed until further notice.
* If your room is locked, check with building Core Team to see if a nearby room is available.
