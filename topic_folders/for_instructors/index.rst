FOR INSTRUCTORS
=======================


This material is for current and aspiring Carpentries Instructors.
Find material here on becoming an Instructor, how you can develop as an Instructor, and what networking opportunities 
our community offers.

**Thank You to Instructors!**

We are very grateful to our community of Instructors! From those who teach once or twice a 
year to those who organise entire programs, from those who have just gotten involved to those who have 
deeply embedded themselves as mentors, discussion hosts, committee and Task Force members, and 
instructor Trainers: EVERY Instructor helps make the Carpentries what we are. Thank you!!
