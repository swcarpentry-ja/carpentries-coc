## Community Discussions Workflow

This workflow was established for the [Instructor Development Committee Discussion Session Coordinator](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html#discussion-session-coordinator) to organise The Carpentries [Community Discussions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/community_discussions.html). Between January 2020 and September 2020, this workflow will be managed by Angelique van Rensburg from Carpentries Core Team.

### Scheduling Community Discussions

  - The [Call for Community Discussions Facilitators](https://forms.gle/nDgJWUdpaH4gYP9c9) form includes an integration which, when a form response is received, an e-mail is sent to The Carpentries Discussion Session Coordinator who should then open the attachment and review its contents.
- Add potential Community Discussions to [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).
- If the Community Discussions Facilitator proposed a day/time for the community discussion they'll be hosting, add that day/time to [the Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) as TBD in this format:

### Scheduling Pre- and Post-Workshop Community Disucssions

1. Coordinate with Infrastructure Team (Maneesha Sane) regarding quarterly sign-ups. This process has been semi-automated with the use of Calendly.
2. After signups have closed the Community Discussions Coordinator and Infrastructure Team discuss distributions of time slots identified by Discussions Hosts (during sign-up) per week and time zone. This will result in either extending signups (if more are needed), or cancel duplicate/sessions not needed.
3. Once finalised the Infrastructure Team publishes the time slots to the Etherpad.
4. In coordination with IDC's Communications Coordinator, the Community Development Team will coordinate weekly Tweets and schedule messages to go out in Carpentries Clippings, our fortnightly newsletter, regarding upcoming Community Discussion sessions.
5. The final version of the Carpentries Community Calendar is populated from Calendly by the Infrastructure Team.
6. If any additional sessions are added/sessions are changed at a later stage, this is done manually.
7. The Community Discussions Coordinator checks the Etherpad weekly to view signups (perhaps too few) for sessions as well as if any changes have been made and might impact the Carpentries Community Calendar.
8. The Community Discussions Coordinator will periodically write blog posts, update mailing lists and provide information via Slack regarding various Community Discussion matters (i.e. quarterly signups, upcoming themed discussions etc) and will have as much support from the Community Development Team as needed throughout this process.
