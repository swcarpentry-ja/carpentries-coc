### Workshop administration workflow

#### For centrally organized workshops

1. One of the following occurs:
    * Someone submits the [Carpentries workshop request form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/workshop/) 
    * Someone emails team@carpentries.org to request a workshop.
    * Someone contacts a staff member to request a workshop.

1. Program Manager or Workshop Administrator for that region responds to request by email or phone/video call.
    * Give them more information about the Carpentries as needed.
        * [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
        * [Data Carpentry lessons](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
        * [Library Carpentry lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)
    * Ask them for more information about their request.
        * Who is their target population?
        * What curriculum content do they want to cover?
        * What timeframe are they looking to host a workshop?
            * Remind them we need 2-3 months notice
            * Remind them to consider their own schedule and other events that may affect things like room availability
        * Remind them of the budget
            * US$2500 standard fee due to our fiscal sponsor (for non-member university, government, or non-profit sites only)
            * Costs for instructor travel (airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals) are managed entirely between host and instructors. We will look for local instructors but can not guarantee it. Member sites are still responsible for travel costs.
        * Ask them to complete the [official request form](https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/workshop/)  
    * Program Manager or Workshop Administrator records request form in AMY.

1. For non-member sites, Workshop Administrator asks host for invoicing contact, and introduces them to the Business Administrator to begin the invoicing process.

1. Workshop Administrator adds workshop to appropriate tab (by geography) on call for instructors [sign up sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYmN7zn1dcrQTFGunsCq6Pqj82Hs2csoCL9hjt0o3uo/edit#gid=0) and sends email to instructors list notifying them of upcoming opportunities.

1. Workshop Administrator reviews list of instructors signed up as interested in upcoming workshops and tentatively places them based on experience, geography, and skill set. See [blog post for details](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/assign-instructors.html).  Selection guidelines include:

    * **Other workshops has that person signed up for in that time period**  If they have volunteered to teach three workshops over the next few months, we likely won’t place them at all of them. However, we will take advantage of their flexibility to get them in on at least one.
    * **Each person's experience with The Carpentries** We want to be sure to match up experienced instructors with new instructors, so new instructors are supported by experienced instructors. 
    * **Each person's skill set with Carpentries material**  We want to make sure each instructor is comfortable teaching the workshop content, and understands the other instructor's skills.
    * **Each person's acadmic or professional domain** It can be helpful, but not required, to match the instructors' domain with the workshop audience. Instructors get opportunities to network in their fields, and learners get to hear from people working in those same fields.
    * **Geography** While we do not guarantee local instructors at workshops, we do take this in consideration to keep the host site's cost down and to help build local communities.
