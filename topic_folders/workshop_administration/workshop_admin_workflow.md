### Workshop administration workflow

#### For centrally organized workshops

1. One of the following occurs:
    * Someone submits a workshop request form for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) or [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/).
    * Someone emails team@carpentries.org to request a workshop.
    * Someone contacts a staff memeber to request a workshop.

1. Program Manager or Workshop Administrator for that region responds to request by email or phone/video call.
    * Give them more information about the Carpentries as needed.
        * Links to [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and [Data Carpentry lessons](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
    * Ask them for more information about their request.
        * Who is their target population?
        * What curriculum content do they want to cover?
        * What timeframe are they looking to host a workshop?
            * Remind them we need 2-3 months notice
            * Remind them to consider their own schedule and other events that may affect things like room availabiltiy
        * Remind them of the budget
            * US$2500 standard fee due to our fiscal sponsor (for non-member university, government, or non-profit sites only)
            * Costs for instructor travel (airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals) are managed entirely between host and instructors. We will look for local instructors but can not guarantee it. Member sites are still responsible for travel costs.
        * Ask them to complete the official request form for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) or [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/) if they have not already 
    * Program Manager or Workshop Administrator records request form in AMY.
