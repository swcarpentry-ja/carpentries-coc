WORKSHOP ADMINISTRATION
========================

Around the world, Carpentries workshops are organised by a team of Regional Coordinators.
Our Core Team Workshop and Logistics Manager manages workshops in most of the world. In some parts of the world, local Carpenters support managing local workshops and building local communities. They work with our member sites or as volunteers. `Read more <https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/>`_ about who they are and what they do.

This section outlines their work specifically as it relates to workshop administration.
