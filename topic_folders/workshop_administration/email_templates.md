##### For Self Organised Workshops: Recruiting Co-instructor

Subject: Recruiting co-instructors for Carpentry Workshop

Hi [ person name ], 

I'm organising a local [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry workshop for [ estimated month/season of workshop ].  The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they've learned to their own work. I'm really excited about using the [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/Core Team/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

I've completed instructor training for The Carpentries and am certified to teach their materials. To run a workshop, I'll need at least one (preferably two) co-instructors to help out in teaching the material. The workshops are two days long and instructors usually switch every half day. I'm planning to cover [ your workshop topics ] and was hoping you could teach the [ topic ] section of the workshop. The Carpentries provides ready-to-go lesson materials, so we wouldn't need to develop anything from scratch. If you're interested, you can see the materials for [ topic ] here [ link to lesson ] and the rest of the curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ or https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ or https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/].

I'm looking forward to running a workshop here and think it will be very helpful to our [ target audience ]. If you're interested in being a co- instructor, please let me know and we can get together and plan. Also let me know if you know anyone else who might be interested and able to help out with the [ topic ] part of the workshop.

Looking forward to working with you on this!

Best,

##### Recruiting Helpers

Subject: Recruiting helpers for Carpentry Workshop

Hi [ name ], 

I'm running a [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry workshop on [ dates of workshop ]. The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they've learned to their own work. I'm really excited about using the [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/Core Team/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.

During the workshop, I'll need a few people to help out in case learners run into problems or get stuck. Helpers move around the room to answer questions and help learners work through things like installation problems, error messages and unexpected output. You don't need to be an expert in the tools we're covering, just to have used one or more of them and be comfortable helping people troubleshoot. At this workshop, we're planning on covering [ list of your topics ]. I think you would be a great person to help out with [ topic ]. If you're interested, you can see the materials for [ topic]  here [link to lesson] and the rest of the curricular materials here [link to http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/ or https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/ or https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/].  Please let me know if you're interested in being a helper and if you know anyone else who might be willing to help out.

Best,

The Carpentries is a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. They teach skills that are immediately useful for researchers, using lessons and datasets that allow researchers to quickly apply what they've learned to their own work. I'm really excited about using the [ Data/Library/Software ] Carpentry curriculum here to help our [graduate students/Core Team/faculty - your target audience] become more efficient in their research.


This workshop is focused on [ Carpentry/domain ]. The curriculum will include:

- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]
- [names of lessons]

The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience, and the instructors put a priority on creating a friendly environment to empower researchers and enable data-driven discovery. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal is to teach not only how to do analyses, but how to manage the process to make it as automated and reproducible as possible. For instance, after attending this workshop you will be able to:

- [skill 1]
- [skill 2]
- [skill 3]

Space is limited and it will likely fill quickly. [ Add sentence about whether workshop is free or if there is a fee. ].
