## Mentoring Subcommittee

### Mission Statement
Established in 2015 to develop and maintain a mentoring program, the program supports instructors as they progress through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities. We help promote community-building and networking, by providing virtual spaces where instructors from all over the world can share teaching success stories and discuss teaching strategies.

### What We Do
* Meets as a committee once a month.
* Hosts weekly discussion sessions.

* Discuss how to improve the instructor discussions.
* Brainstorm ways to make the instructor check out process more useful and efficient.
* Build a discussion host community, so hosting duties do not fall onto a handful of people every time.
* How can we better mentor and connect new/experienced instructors?
* How to encourage members of the community to become more involved?
* How can we support instructors in parts of the world where there is not currently a local supportive community? How can our community build/grow in places in which the Carpentries may or may not currently exist?
