##### Initial Member Contact Email (online training)

SUBJECT: Carpentries Instructor Training for [ site_name ]

Hi [ site contact name ],

Congratulations on your institution’s 
[ new membership with The Carpentries / Carpentries membership renewal ]. 
As a [silver/gold/platinum] member, you have a total of [ number ] 
seats in Instructor Training available to you. We’d like to get you
set up for Instructor Training early in your membership year so that
your new Instructors can productively build a Carpentries community 
at your institution. 

We run two-day, online Instructor Training workshops multiple times 
per month. These events are scheduled for a range of time zones, to 
better serve our global community. We recommend, if possible, that 
your trainees join the same training event and are co-localized. 
This enables them to know each other over the course of the event 
and build up your local community.  We recognize that it can be 
difficult to coordinate everyone’s schedules, however, so we do 
provide the flexibility of trainees joining different events. If 
your trainees are not able to attend an event together as a team,
we recommend that you host a social event for your trainees (and 
others in your community) to get together. 

To register, please direct your team members to our Instructor
Training workshop registration page
(http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html). 
Your trainees should register with the code: [ insert code here in bold ]. 
This code can be used [ number ] times. Please be sure to share this
code with your trainees. They should also fill out our application form
( https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/ )
using the same code. For guidance about how to select your 
trainees, please visit our Information for Member Organisations page
at http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/. 

You can use this email template (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/email_templates_admin.html#initial-trainee-contact-email-from-member-site-to-their-prospective-trainees-online-training) to send this information to 
your group. If one of your affiliates is not able to attend after 
they've registered for an event, please get in touch with us at 
team@carpentries.org as soon as possible. In some cases, we will be 
able to transfer your training seat to another event. However, 
because the success of our program depends on accurately predicting 
our capacity needs, we may not be able to accommodate changes in 
registration unless we are notified in advance of the event.

For more information about our Instructor Training program, including 
details about our curriculum, certification process, and logistical 
details of the training event itself, please visit our Information 
for Member Organisations page at 
http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/. 

I’m excited to help you build your team of Carpentries instructors at 
[ site_name ]. Please let me know once you’ve shared this 
registration information with your trainees so we know that your team
is ready to come on board. Feel free to  get in touch if you have any 
questions about this process, including checking on the status of 
your remaining seats.

##### One Week Trainee Email (online training)

SUBJECT: Information for your upcoming Instructor Training with The Carpentries

Hello everyone,

Thank you for registering for The Carpentries Instructor Training 
workshop on [ DATE-TIME-TIMEZONE ]. This email contains important 
information to help you prepare for the training - please read it 
carefully and let me know if you have any questions. 

This training is for people who want to become certified Carpentries 
instructors. This workshop will introduce you to evidence-based 
best-practices of teaching. We will teach you how to create a 
positive environment for learners at your workshops, provide 
opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills, 
help you become integrated into the Carpentries community, and 
prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentries 
workshops. For more information about what will be covered at this 
training, check out our Instructor Training curriculum: 
http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/.

This is training for teaching, not technical training. We recommend 
that you be familiar with at least one of the technologies that we 
teach (R, Python, the Unix bash shell, SQL, OpenRefine, spreadsheet
software, and/or Git) before taking Instructor Training. We will not
be covering the contents of our workshop curricula during Instructor
Training, but we do provide optional post-training onboarding 
sessions and mentoring opportunities to help prepare Instructors to 
teach particular curricula.

Our instructor Trainers [ trainer1 ] and [ trainer2 ] will be leading
your training. This online training will be conducted using the Zoom 
video conferencing platform.  No log in is needed, but you may need 
to install a browser extension. To access the training please use 
this link: [INSERT LINK]. All participants are required to have 
their own laptop and earbuds/headphones. Some participants may be
attending the training in the same room. If this is the case, please
be sure that everyone is wearing their earbuds/headphones and are 
muted at all times when not speaking. Your Trainers have put 
together a workshop website with information about the schedule: 
[INSERT LINK]

Attendance is required for the full two-days of the workshop in order
to certify as a Carpentries Instructor. Participants who miss more 
than one hour will not pass our training requirements. If you know 
ahead of time that you will miss an hour of the training, please 
notify your Trainers.

Before your training, please: 
- Complete our pre-workshop survey [INSERT LINK]. Your responses will help your Trainers understand your background and customize the workshop appropriately. 

- Read this short paper: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.

- Go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or the Library Carpentry lessons page (https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) to see what we currently teach. Carefully read through one episode of your choice. You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises, so be sure you are comfortable with the content. Note: an episode is not the entire lesson, but a single page of the lesson.

After your training, you will be asked to do three follow-up 
exercises online in order to become a certified Instructor. These 
requirements are detailed at 
http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/ and will
be discussed at your training. If you have any questions about the 
workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please don’t 
hesitate to get in touch.

Happy Training - we are excited to have you on board!

##### Follow-up - Trainers Attendance List

Hi [INSERT TRAINERS NAMES], 

Thank you for taking time to teach the Carpentries Instructor Training on [INSERT DATES]! I hope you had a great experience. I am following up with you to obtain the attendance from the training. 

For your convenience, I have included the names of trainees in this [INSERT FILE]. Please indicate the attendance for both days so that I can record their progress and get them on track to becoming certified Carpentries instructors! 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

##### Zoom test invitation to host site

Hi [Host Name],

Thank you for hosting a Carpentries Instructor Training on 
[ date/time including time zone]. We will be using the Zoom 
videoconferencing platform for this event.  To ensure that the 
training runs smoothly, I’d like to set up a Zoom test run with you 
prior to the event. This should not take much time, however, it is 
important that this happens to detect any problems and have time to 
troubleshoot them prior to the training. We all want to stick to the
schedule, and want to avoid spending time troubleshooting on the 
morning of the event.

A few things to consider when conducting the test:
* Be in the room that the training will take place in. 
* Have access to the audio system that will be used
* Have access to the projector that will be used

We will make sure that we can see and hear each other, and that I can
see all the seats people will be in for the event itself.

To schedule a test run, you can [ email me/look at my calendar ]. 
Please let me know if you cannot find a time that works, so we can 
look for some other options.

I'm looking forward to having your team on board! Please let me know
if you have any questions about how this works.

Best, 
[ sender name ]

##### Response to Instructor Training Inquiry

Hi [ name ],

Thank you for your interest in becoming a Carpentry Instructor! It
sounds like you might be interested in applying to our Open 
Instructor Training program. Training slots are made available for 
Open applicants when they are not claimed by a member institution 
one month in advance. Because this happens unpredictably, we 
sometimes have a backlog of applications. We are currently working
to address these needs and anticipate reduced wait times for Open 
training, but there may still be some delay.

We rank applications on a rolling basis, and we encourage all 
interested parties to apply. Many things influence selection, 
including regional, institutional, discipline, and diversity-related
priorities, as well as relevant background and involvement with The 
Carpentries. Multiple applicants from a single institution generally
will not be invited at once, but may be accepted individually over 
time. To more rapidly build an Instructor community at your 
institution, consider becoming a Member. For more information see:
https://carpentries.org/membership/.

The instructor training application is here: 
https://amy.software-carpentry.org/forms/request_training/. 
In order to have your application considered for Open training, 
be sure to leave the “group” entry space blank. Note that the 
expectations for Instructors are also listed on this page, 
and are a good idea to check before applying.

Thank you again for your interest in The Carpentries! I look forward 
to seeing you around the community.

Best regards,

[ sender name ]

##### Recruiting new Trainers

Subject: Opportunity to join The Carpentries Trainers community

Hi [ name ],

I wanted to get in touch with you about an opportunity to get involved with The Carpentries community. Software Carpentry (SWC), Library Carpentry (LC), and Data Carpentry (DC) are lesson programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initaitives). We are focused on spreading computational literacy to researchers around the world. We run intensive, hands-on, two-day workshops to help researchers and other professionals develop the fundamental computational skills they need to do their research. Together, we run over 300 workshops a year, and have reached more than 25,000 learners in 30 countries.

Our workshops are taught by volunteers who go through a two-day training program focused on pedagogy and cognitive psychology. These training events are run by our Instructor Trainers who also help to develop and maintain our instructor training curriculum. 

Carpentry Trainers are an eclectic group. Some of us have formal training in pedagogy, some are experienced Carpentry instructors, others run Carpentry-like trainings as part of their jobs. We all share a commitment to helping new instructors become familiar and comfortable with Carpentry teaching practices and principles.

If you’re interested in joining the Trainer community, please apply here (https://goo.gl/forms/yTx9yJzdWy6OAPtS2)! Applications for this round will be open until [application_deadline]. 

If you have any questions about the training process or the expectations for being a Trainer, please contact team@carpentries.org

To learn more about what we teach, check out our lessons here: (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), here: (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), and here: (https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/).

Looking forward to seeing an application from you!

##### Accepting new Trainers

Subject: Congratulations! Join the Carpentries Trainer Community

Hi all,

Thank you all for applying to become instructor Trainers with the Carpentries. A group of Trainers have reviewed the applications and we're excited to invite each of you to the Trainer team.

We'll be starting our new cohort of instructor Trainers in [ month ]. Our cohort will be [ number ] folks located in [ countries ]. We'll be meeting once a week starting in [ month ] to discuss our text and how it relates to our instructor training curriculum. More details can be found in the preliminary reading schedule.

If you're interested in being part of this cohort, please try to complete the following by [ deadline ] so that we can finalize the schedule and start our meetings!

1) Please fill out this poll [ link ] for scheduling book club meetings. Don't forget to adjust the timezone shown (pull down menu above the time list). Please choose the days and times that work for you for the entire 8 week period of our book club. To complete certification as a Trainer, we'll ask that you miss at most one of our 8 book club meetings. Since we are spread across several time zones, please be as accommodating as possible in filling out your availability. We will have two meeting times per week to accomodate all time zones, but you will only need to attend one of the weekly meetings.

2) Please take a look over the process for trainer training and make sure that all of the requirements of becoming a Trainer work with your schedule and other responsibilities. We're excited to have you in the Trainer community, but do want to make sure that all Trainers are able to commit the time required, so that we are able to realistically determine the number of instructors we train per year.

3) Please get a copy of our text [ link ]. I'll send out reading assignments and discussion guides in a later email. 

4) Please also fill out your availability for instructor training events for [ month through month ] and add your name to the Trainers list in the second tab. This cohort of Trainers will be ready to co-teach instructor training events by the end of [ month ] and to teach on their own shortly after that.

5) Please add upcoming Trainer meetings (http://pad.software-carpentry.org/trainers-backup) to your calendar. These are also on the Community Calendar. Each of these is held in two different time zones - you don't need to attend both meetings, but you're welcome to!

6) Please sign up for the Trainers email list (http://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/trainers) if you haven't already done so.

7) Please respond to this email with a quick introduction so that we can all get to know each other. I'll send out my introduction as a separate email following this.

I know that's a lot! Let me know if you have any questions. I'm looking forward to seeing you all at our first book club discussion.

Best,
