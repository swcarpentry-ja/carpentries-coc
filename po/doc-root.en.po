msgstr ""

#: readme.md:74
msgid "Something in this template causes `.md` extensions to get stripped, breaking links to things like markdown documents in a GitHub repo.  This can be fixed by adding an anchor tag (`#`) to the end of the url.  For example, `https://github.com/carpentries/handbook/blob/topic_folders/file.md` would become `https://github.com/carpentries/handbook/blob/topic_folders/file.md#`. "

Changes can be previewed live here: <http://docs-src.carpentries.org/>.  Changes to the actual site <https://docs.carpentries.org/>  can take up to a day to go live once changes have been pushed to GitHub, since the contents of the site are behind a CDN (Content Distribution Network) that caches content."

#: readme.md:81
msgid "If you are making experimental changes to content please be sure to do so in a non-main, non-live branch. When your changes are complete and ready to be pushed to the live site, open a pull request in [carpentries/handbook](https://github.com/carpentries/handbook)."

Draft content is not built to the live site and these files may contain inaccurate or out of date information."
