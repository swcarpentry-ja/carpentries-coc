### Blog post ideas

We welcome blog posts from our community members about their experiences with the Carpentries or resources of interest to the community.  Below are some guiding questions based on the blog post topic. These are just suggestions; please use them if helpful but feel free to structure your post in any way that makes sense to you.

#### Blogging about instructor training events

*What was interesting about your group of trainees?* Tell us about your trainees. Were they from a specific domain or field or spread across a wide range of fields? Do they come from a region or institutional type that is under-represented in the Carpentry community? What was their previous involvement with the Carpentries? What are they excited about becoming Carpentry instructors?

*How did your trainees respond to the curriculum?* Did you do anything differently from the standard instructor training curriculum? How did it work out? What parts of the training resonated with your trainees? Were there any parts that didn’t go as well? Why do you think that was and what could be done differently next time?

*Did anything unique happen?* What new ideas did your trainees have that you hadn’t thought of before? Did they make any suggestions about improvements to our instructor training or workshop curricula that you’re excited about? What was the most exciting discussion your group had during the training event? 

*What advice do you have for new instructors?* What do you wish someone had told you when you first became an instructor? Do you have any words of wisdom? How can we welcome your new group of trainees to the Carpentry community?
